Agent: Applies Kim & Mauborgne framework — Strategy Canvas + Four Actions

You: "Uncover the real JTBD for our SaaS. Use jobs-to-be-done skill."
Agent: Runs Christensen's framework — hiring managers, competing hires

You: "Design a Cold Calling 2.0 outbound process. Use predictable-revenue skill."
Agent: Outputs ICP, 3-email sequence, qualification criteria, pipeline math
